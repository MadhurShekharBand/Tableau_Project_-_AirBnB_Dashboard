# Introduction:
In this project, I developed an interactive dashboard using Tableau to analyse Airbnb listings in Seattle over the past year. The goal was to answer key questions about revenue, room type distribution, listing sizes, and price variations by geographic locations and other factors. The insights gained through this analysis can help Airbnb hosts optimize their pricing strategies and understand market trends, while also offering potential guests valuable information when choosing accommodations.

# Background:
### The questions I wanted to answer through this project were:
- **What is the revenue generated by Airbnb listings in Seattle on a weekly basis for the past year?** <br>
This question aims to identify the weekly revenue patterns for Airbnb listings in Seattle over a year. By analyzing this, we can detect trends in revenue fluctuations, seasonal impacts, and overall market growth. This insight can help hosts optimize their pricing strategy and predict demand for different periods throughout the year.

- **For Airbnb listings in Seattle, which room types (Entire home/Apartment, Private room, Shared room) are more popular?** <br>
This question seeks to understand the distribution of room types across Airbnb listings in Seattle. It will provide insight into the market segmentation and which room types are in demand. Understanding these percentages helps hosts tailor their offerings and pricing, and it can help potential guests understand the available options for their stay.

- **What is the distribution of listings based on the number of bedrooms?** <br>
Knowing the distribution of listings based on the number of bedrooms will help identify the availability of different-sized properties, which is crucial for potential guests seeking specific accommodations. It also offers insights into the type of inventory available in the market and can guide hosts in making informed decisions about property size and targeting their ideal guest base.

- **What is the average price of Airbnb listings based on the number of bedrooms?** <br>
This question explores how the price of Airbnb listings in Seattle varies depending on the number of bedrooms. It will provide a clear picture of how much guests are likely to pay based on the size of the accommodation. This information is valuable for both potential guests when budgeting their stay and for hosts to price their properties competitively based on size.

- **What is the average price of Airbnb listings by zipcode in Seattle?** <br>
This question investigates how the average price of Airbnb listings varies across different zip codes in Seattle. By examining this, we can identify areas with higher or lower average prices, offering insights into regional price trends. This helps guests choose accommodations within their budget and allows hosts to understand how their pricing compares to similar properties in different neighbourhoods.

- **What is the average price of Airbnb listings by geographic location within Seattle?**
This question aims to understand how the average price of Airbnb listings changes depending on the geographic location within the city. By exploring the price differences across various parts of Seattle, we can uncover areas of higher or lower demand, helping hosts strategically price their listings and providing guests with valuable information when choosing locations based on their budget and preferences.

### About the Dataset:
The datasets used for this project includes 3 CSV files: AirBnB_Data_Calendar, Airbnb_Data_Listings and Airbnb_Data_Reviews. The three datasets provide information on Airbnb listings, their availability, and guest reviews in Seattle. Together, these datasets offer a robust set of data for analyzing Airbnb listings, their pricing, availability trends, and user experiences.
<br>
<br>
The first dataset, Airbnb_Data_Calendar, contains daily records of the availability and price for different listings, marking whether a listing is available or not and the corresponding price when available. The second dataset, Airbnb_Data_Listings, includes detailed information about each listing, such as property type, location, amenities, host details, pricing, availability, and reviews, providing a comprehensive view of individual Airbnb properties. The third dataset, Airbnb_Data_Reviews, records guest reviews, including comments and ratings for each listing, along with reviewer details.

### Tools I Used:
For my deep dive into the datasets, I harnessed the power of one key tool:
- **Tableau:** For this project, Tableau was the primary tool used to analyze and visualize the Airbnb data. Tableau allowed me to easily connect to the datasets, perform various transformations, and create interactive visualizations to answer the key questions.

# Insights:
- The revenue generated by Airbnb listings in Seattle has varied week to week throughout the year. The data shows a general upward trend in revenue over the course of the year, with some fluctuations. This suggests a growing demand for Airbnb listings in Seattle, particularly during peak periods such as holidays and summer months. Hosts can leverage this information to optimize their pricing strategy, capitalizing on high-demand weeks to maximize revenue.
- The majority of Airbnb listings in Seattle are entire homes or apartments, which likely cater to families or groups seeking more privacy and space. This provides insight into the preferences of most visitors to Seattle and can guide potential hosts in deciding what type of property to offer based on demand.
- A significant portion of listings consists of 1-bedroom units, suggesting that smaller properties dominate the market in Seattle. This indicates that the demand for single-occupant or small-group accommodations is high, while larger properties with more bedrooms are relatively scarce. Hosts might consider focusing on one-bedroom listings to meet the market's most prominent demand.
- The average price increases with the number of bedrooms, as expected. This indicates that larger properties command higher rates, and guests are likely willing to pay more for additional space. Hosts can use this information to strategically price their listings based on the number of bedrooms, ensuring competitiveness in their respective market segments.
- The data shows significant price variation across Seattle's neighbourhoods. Zip codes which are likely in high-demand, central or tourist-heavy areas, have the highest average prices. This information can guide hosts in understanding the pricing dynamics of different neighbourhoods, enabling them to set competitive prices based on location and demand. Guests can also use this to choose areas that fit their budget while still offering quality accommodations.

# Conclusion:
### What I Learned:
Throughout this project, I learned the importance of visualizing data to uncover hidden trends and insights. By using Tableau, I was able to create a dynamic and interactive dashboard that allowed for a comprehensive analysis of various factors, such as weekly revenue patterns, room type distribution, and price variations by bedrooms and neighbourhoods. I learned how different variables impact pricing and demand, and how market dynamics fluctuate based on factors like geographic location and property size. Additionally, I gained valuable experience in data cleaning and preparation, ensuring the datasets were suitable for in-depth analysis.

### Closing Thoughts:
This project was a great opportunity to apply data visualization techniques to real-world data and draw actionable insights. It demonstrated the power of using business intelligence tools like Tableau to interpret large datasets, allowing for more informed decisions by both Airbnb hosts and guests.
